            <td>Hi, I'm Milan, a 17-year-old A-Level student at Parmiter's School. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science, English Literature, and Design and Technology.

                Inside and outside of school, I've been entrusted with numerous roles of responsibility even since Primary School where I helped to achieve a Green Flag Award in the 'Eco-Council', served as a member of the 'Google Champions', was a School Captain, and was Form Captain. At <i>Parmiter’s School</i>, I've held roles like Deputy Form Captain, and currently am a House Captain and an Equalities Prefect.

                <br>    
                Beyond academics, I also take part in various societies and clubs, co-running the LGBTQ+ Society and the Hackathon Club whilst being a member of the English Society and the Feminist Society.

            <td colspan="2">My involvement extends to the digital world as a member of the <i>PoleisMC</i> Minecraft Staff team, where I oversaw events as Events Coordinater and managed Discord servers and social media accounts. This experience honed my skills in fairness, equity, and unbiased decision-making. Alongside this volunteering, I am a Discord Admin and Software Tester for <i><a href="https://www.knowt.com" target="_blank">Knowt</a></i> and a Life and Style Helper on <i><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Student Room</a></i>.

                <br>
                Academically, I've achieved proficiency in programming languages including Python, SQL, C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, I'm also expanding my language skills with a focus on itish Sign Language (BSL). I've also explored musical interests, from achieving Grade 2 on the Violin to being self-taught in playing the guitar. I have also previously taken part in martial arts training in karate, swimming since the age of 5, and accomplishments like the Bronze CREST Award, completion of iDEA badges (of which, my Record of Achievement can be found <i><a href="https://idea.org.uk/roa/XDEBYRGGBS" target="_blank">here</a>)</i>, and a Level One ‘Sports Leaders’ award in 2022.</p>
