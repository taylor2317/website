<div class="aboutBody">
    <p>Hi, I'm Milan, a 16-year-old A-Level student at Parmiter's School. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science, English Literature, and Design and Technology. Back in my GCSEs, I studied: English Literature, Mathematics, Combined Science, French, Computer Science, Product Design, and Geography.
    
        Inside and outside of school, I've been entrusted with numerous roles of responsibility since Primary School; from contributing to achieving a Green Flag Award in the 'Eco-Council' to serving as a member of the 'Google Champions', I've been actively involved. At Parmiter’s School, I've held roles like Deputy Form Captain and House Captain, contributing to the Equalities Committee.
        
        Beyond academics, I also take part in various societies and clubs, co-running the LGBTQ+ Society and the Hackathon Club while being a member of the English Society and the Feminist Society.
        
        My involvement extends to the digital world as a member of the PoleisMC Minecraft Staff team, where I manage Discord servers and social media accounts. This experience has honed my skills in fairness and unbiased decision-making.
        
        In the professional realm, I've been a Crew Member at McDonald's since July 2023, allowing me to create a disciplined work ethic. I've also contributed as a Life and Style Helper on The Student Room and worked on social media accounts for Freelance Associated Media.
    
        Academically, I've achieved proficiency in programming languages like Python, SQL, C, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I'm also expanding my language skills with a focus on itish Sign Language (BSL). I've also explored diverse interests, from achieving Grade 2 on the Violin to being self-taught in playing the guitar.
        
        My journey includes martial arts training in karate, swimming since the age of 5, and accomplishments like the Bronze CREST Award, completion of iDEA badges, and a Level One ‘Sports Leaders’ award in 2022.</p>
